\chapter{Python implementation of EKE}

While researching Bellovin and Merritt's EKE scheme\cite{eke}, I created a full implementation of the scheme in Python.
The full code can be found at \url{https://github.com/tritoke/eke_python}.
The core negotiation functions for the client and server have been included below:

\pythoncode[minted options={firstline=36,lastline=76,gobble=4}]{Client Negotiate}{eke_python/client.py}
\pythoncode[minted options={firstline=50,lastline=81,gobble=4}]{Server Negotiate}{eke_python/server.py}
