\gls{pake} algorithms are a niche kind of cryptography where parties seek
to establish a strong shared key, from a low entropy secret such as a password.
This makes it particularly attractive to some domains, such as \gls{iiot}.
However many \gls{pake} algorithms are unsuitable for \gls{iot} applications, due
to their heavy computational requirements. \gls{aucpace} is a new \gls{pake}
protocol which aims to make \glspl{pake} accessible to \gls{iiot} by utilising
\gls{ecc}, \glspl{vpake} and a novel augmented approach. This project aims to
provide an approachable and developer-focused implementation of \gls{aucpace}
in Rust and to contribute this implementation back to RustCrypto to promote wider
adoption of \gls{pake} algorithms.
