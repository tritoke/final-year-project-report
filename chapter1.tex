\section{Background on PAKEs}
\subsection{What is a PAKE?}
\glspl{pake} are interactive, two party cryptographic protocols where each party shares knowledge of a password (a low entropy secret) and seeks to obtain a strong shared key e.g. for use later with a symmetric cipher. Critically an eavesdropper who can listen in two all messages of the key negotiation cannot learn enough information to bruteforce the password. Another way of phrasing this is that brute force attacks on the key must be "\glslink{ocrypto}{online}".

\subsection{A brief history of PAKE algorithms}
The first \gls{pake} algorithm was Bellovin and Merritt's EKE scheme\cite{eke}.
