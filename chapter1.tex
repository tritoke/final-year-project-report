\section{Background on PAKEs}
\subsection{What is a PAKE?}
\glspl{pake} are interactive, two party cryptographic protocols where each party shares knowledge of a password (a low entropy secret) and seeks to obtain a strong shared key e.g. for use later with a symmetric cipher. Critically an eavesdropper who can listen in two all messages of the key negotiation cannot learn enough information to bruteforce the password. Another way of phrasing this is that brute force attacks on the key must be "\glslink{ocrypto}{online}".

\medskip
There are two main types of \gls{pake} algorithm - \glspl{apake} and \glspl{bpake}.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \glspl{bpake} are \glspl{pake} where both parties share knowledge of the same secret password.
  \item \glspl{apake} are \glspl{pake} where one party has the password and the other has a "\gls{veri}" which is computed via a one-way function from the secret password.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{A brief history of PAKE algorithms}
The first \gls{pake} algorithm was Bellovin and Merritt's \gls{eke} scheme \cite{eke}.
It works using a mix of \gls{symcrypto} and \gls{asymcrypto} to perform a key exchange.
This comes with many challenges and subtle mistakes that are easy to make;
primarily for the security of the system whatever is encrypted by the shared secret key(P) must be indistinguishable from random data.
Otherwise an attacker can determine whether their guess at a trial decryption is valid.
The \gls{rsa} variant of \gls{eke} has this issue - the \gls{rsa} parameter $e$ is what is encrypted and sent in the first message.
For \gls{rsa} all valid values of $e$ are odd, so this would prevent it being used.
This is solved by adding $1$ to $e$ with a $50\%$ chance.
\Cref{fig:eke-rsa} shows this protocol in full. While many of the initial variants on \gls{eke} have been shown to flawed/vulnerable, later variants have made it into real world use, such as in \gls{eap} \cite{eap} where it is available as \gls{eap}-\gls{eke} \cite{eap-eke}.
In \cref{chap:appendix-eke} you can find a Python implementation of this scheme

\subsubsection{An Aside on Notation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\shortleftarrow$: Assignment - $x \shortleftarrow \ 5$ means x is assigned a value of 5.
  \item $\cryptoSample$: Sampling from a given set - $x \cryptoSample \ \mathbb{R}$ means to choose $x$ at random from the set of real numbers.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SPAKE}
\glslink{spake}{SPAKE1} and \glslink{spake}{SPAKE2} are \glspl{bpake}' which were introduced slightly later on by Michel Abdalla and David Pointcheval \cite{spake} as variations on \gls{eke}.
They are very similar so we will just explore \glslink{spake}{SPAKE2} as we are more interested in \glslink{ocrypto}{online} algorithms.
\gls{spake} differs from EKE in the following ways:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The encryption function is replaced by a simple one-time pad.
  \item The \gls{asymcrypto} is provided by \gls{dh}
  \item There is no explicit mutual authentication phase where challenges are exchanged.
    This has the advantage of reducing the number of messages that need to be sent.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{SRP}
Finally we will look at \gls{srp} an \gls{apake} first published in 1998, unlike \glslink{spake}{SPAKE2} it is not a modification of \gls{eke}.
\gls{srp} has gone through many revisions, at time of writing \glslink{srp}{SRP6a} is the latest version.
\gls{srp} is likely the most used \gls{pake} protocol in the world due to it's use in Apple's iCloud Keychain \cite{apple-keychain-srp} and it's availability as a \gls{tls} ciphersuite \cite{tls-srp}.
However it is quite weird for what it does and there is no security proof for it \cite{srp-blog}. An implementation of the protocol in Python can be found in \cref{chap:appendix-srp}.

\section{Elliptic Curve Cryptography}
Many modern Cryptograhpic protocols make use of a mathematical object known as an elliptic curve.
First proposed in 1985 independently by Neal Koblitz \cite{ecc-first-use-koblitz} and Victor S. Miller \cite{ecc-first-use-miller}.
Elliptic curves are attractive to cryptographers as they maintain a very high level of strength at smaller key sizes, this allows for protocols to consume less bandwidth, less memory and execute faster \cite{state-of-ecc}.
To illustrate just how great the size savings are - \gls{nist} suggests that an elliptic curve key of just 256 bits provides the same level of security as an \gls{rsa} key of 3072 bits \cite{nist-ecc-reqs}.

\subsection{But what actually is an elliptic curve?}
With regards to Cryptography elliptic curves tend to come in one of two forms:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Short Weierstra\ss{} Form: $y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$
  \item Montgomery Form: $by^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + x$
\end{itemize}

    \node at (8,-5) {Montgomery Form};
  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{figure}

Weierstra\ss{} form is special as it is the general case for all elliptic curves, meaning all elliptic curves can be expressed as a Weierstra\ss{} curve.
This property means that it is commonly used for expressing various curves.
Montgomery form isn't quite as flexible, however it is favourable because it leads to significantly faster multiplication and addition operations via Montgomery's ladder \cite{montgom-ladder}.

\subsection{How do we do Cryptography with curves?}
To perform Cryptography with elliptic curves we need to define an "\gls{abgroup}" to work in.
An \gls{abgroup} is a group whose group operation is also commutative, for example the addition operator over the integers: ($+$, $\ZZ$) is an \gls{abgroup}.
\glspl{abgroup} form the basis of many modern Cryptographic algorithms, a \gls{dh} key exchange can be performed in any \gls{abgroup} for instance.

Our \gls{abgroup} is built on the idea of "adding" points on the curve.
To add two points, we find the line which passes through our two points and we continue along that line until we hit our curve again.
We then reflect this point in the $x$-axis to get our result.
What if we want to add our point to itself? Now there isn't a unique line through one point, however we are making the rules so in this case we will take the tangent to the curve at that point and then we can treat it the same as before.
What if our line doesn't intersect with the curve? In this case we define a new point called the "neutral element" - $\mathcal{O}$.
It is also called the point at infinity as it can be considered to be the single point at the end of every vertical line at infinity.
\Cref{fig:point-add-rules} illustrates all of these rules and edge cases.

However it's not quite that simple for us. We cannot use $\RR$ as computers only have finite resources we need a finite set to work in. Instead we define our operations over a \gls{ff}, we will use the \gls{ff} of the integers mod a prime, denoted $\ZZ_p$ for some prime $p$. Lets take a look at what our finite fields look like in a small finite field - $\ZZ_{89}$. \begin{figure}[H]

This now looks very different to when we were looking at them in $\RR$, however it shows very clearly what the elements of our set look like.
They are points in the 2d coordinate plane with a symmetry around $p/2$.
This might not feel intuitive but it is actually exactly what we should expect to happen, in our finite field when we negate our point's y coordinate, instead of flipping it around the y-axis, our points get wrapped around $y=p$.
Hence our new point is the same distance from $y=p$ as our first point was with $y=0$, this is where our symmetry arises.

\subsection{Where can Elliptic Curve Cryptography go wrong?}
There are many attacks against various aspects of Elliptic Curves, in general they fall into the following categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \begin{item}
    Attacks against the \gls{ecdlp} security of the curve:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{The rho method \cite{pollard-rho}}
      \item{Transfer Security \cite{multiplicative-transfer-attack,additive-transfer-attack}}
      \item{CM Field Discriminants \cite{safecurves}}
      \item{Curve Rigidity \cite{curve-rigidity}}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{item}
  \begin{item}
    Attacks against the concrete implementation of \gls{ecc}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item{Ladders required for safe and fast point-scalar multiplication \cite{safecurves}}
      \item{Twist Security \cite{small-subgroup-attack,invalid-curve-attack}}
      \item{Completeness \cite{completeness-attack}}
      \item{Indistinguishability \cite{elligator2}}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{item}
\end{itemize}

All of these attacks individually can weaken or even break the security of a given cryptosystem if not accounted for.
However choosing the right curve is a good step in the right direction and can mitigate many of the attacks listed above.

\section{Modern PAKEs}
Recently many novel \glspl{pake} algorithms have been published, this is partly due to a request from the \gls{ietf} for the \gls{irtf} \gls{cfrg} to carry out a selection process to choose a \gls{pake} for usage in \gls{ietf} protocols.
That process concluded in 2020 with \gls{cpace} and \gls{opaque} being chosen as the recommended \gls{bpake} and \gls{apake} respectively \cite{cfrg-pake-selection-results}.

Some time has passed since this process and we now have some new \glspl{pake} with various interesting properties that are worth taking a look at.

\subsection{CHIP+CRISP}
Introduced in \citeyear{chip+crisp} by \citeauthor{chip+crisp}, CHIP and CRISP are two protocol compilers which instanciate what the authors call an \gls{ipake} \cite{chip+crisp}.
\glspl{ipake} are designed to mitigate the threat of compromising the local storage of a device.
While in the case of \glspl{apake} this is considered for the server side, \glspl{bpake} often require both parties to have knowledge of the plaintext password.
Examples of this include SPAKE-2 \cite{spake} and WPA3's DragonFly/SAE \cite{sae}, both of which require the server and client to have knowledge of the plaintext password.
CHIP+CRISP solves this problem by binding the password to an arbitrary bit-string called the identity, this can be anything, e.g. "server", "router", "jonathandata0".
CHIP and CRISP are both protocol compilers, this means that they aren't themselves protocols but they sit on top of another protocol in order to give that sub-protocol the aforementioned properties, by protecting the underlying data they exchange.

\subsection{KHAPE}
\gls{khape} \cite{khape} is an \gls{apake} from the designers of \gls{opaque}, introduced in \citeyear{khape} it is a variant of \gls{opaque} which doesn't rely on the use of an \gls{oprf} to get \gls{apake} security.
Instead the \gls{oprf} is used to add precomputation resistance, this is also known as a "strong" \gls{pake}.
The advantage of this is that should the \gls{oprf} be compromised the protocol remains secure, and only loses the "strong" part of it's security.
Similarly to CHIP+CRISP, \gls{khape} is not itself a protocol but a compiler from any \gls{ake} to an \gls{apake}.
In the paper they detail the concrete implementation KHAPE-HMQV, which extends the HMQV Authenticated \gls{dh} Protocol from an \gls{ake} to a \gls{apake}.

\subsection{AuCPace}
Although \gls{aucpace} \cite{aucpace} didn't quite make the cut for \gls{ietf} standardisation it is still a very interesting \gls{pake} and well worth a look.
Designed specifically for use in \gls{iiot} applications, \gls{aucpace} is an \gls{apake} protocol intended for use in situations where traditional \gls{pki} simply isn't available.
The protocol is modelled around a powerful \gls{hmi} client device and a weak server device, as this setup is common in \gls{iiot} applications, e.g. one PC being used to configure many sensors/actuators.
Efficiency is at the core of this protocol, it is taken into consideration at every level, from the high-level protocol design to the low-level arithmetic.
A unique bonus of this protocol as well is it takes into account the real-world issue of patents and aims to provide a practical protocol which is free from patents so as to promote the widest possible adoption of the protocol.

\section{Choosing a PAKE to implement}
There were a number of factors I considered when choosing which \gls{pake} to implement:
\begin{itemize}
  \item{How widely applicable is the protocol?}
  \item{How many existing implementations are there?}
  \item{How good are existing solutions?}
\end{itemize}
