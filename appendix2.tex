\chapter{Python implementation of SRP}
\label{chap:appendix-srp}

While conducting my initial research on PAKEs I came across \gls{srp}\cite{srp}.
\gls{srp} is the first protocol I looked at which took the approach of encoding values as \gls{dh} group elements.
To understand this approach better I chose to create a toy implementation.
The full code can be found at \url{https://github.com/tritoke/srp_python}.
The core negotiation functions for the client and server have been included below:

\pythoncode[minted options={firstline=37,lastline=72}]{Client Negotiate}{srp_python/client.py}
\pythoncode[minted options={firstline=57,lastline=115}]{Server Negotiate}{srp_python/server.py}
